Thanks for you interest on this project!

See it live on [fernandobarbat.com](https://fernandobarbat.com).

This project is my cover letter. It was implemented using React and friends. It was also a good opportunity to test React and related technologies.

I only published the React app. The talent agent backend was implemented using Firebase + Anthropic. Let me know if you are interested in that as well. :)
