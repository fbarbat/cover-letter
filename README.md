***WORK IN PROGRESS***

Thanks for you interest on this project!

See it live on [fernandobarbat.com](https://fernandobarbat.com).

This project will be my cover letter. It was implemented using React 
and friends. It is also a good opportunity to test other technologies.

Spectacle dependency victory-core is patched using [patch-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package) while 
[Spectacle](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/) maintainers do not
release an updated dependency to my pull already merged pull request :)
